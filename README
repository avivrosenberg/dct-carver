DCT-Carver
This is a gimp plugin that implements seam-carving with novel DCT-based energy function.

The seam-carving is iplemented by the LiquidRescale library by
Carlo Baldassi (carlobaldassi@gmail.com) and can be obtained at
http://liblqr.wikidot.com

The files in src/fft2d are taken from the fft2d package by 
Takuya OOURA (email: ooura@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp) and have not been changed. 
The full package can be obtained at http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ooura/fft.html.

To install, simple use 'make'. Note that libgimp-dev and LiquidRescale (liblqr) must be installed first.
