DCT-Carver
==========

This is a gimp plugin that implements seam-carving with a novel DCT-based energy function.

The seam-carving is implemented by the LiquidRescale library 
written by Carlo Baldassi (carlobaldassi@gmail.com).
It can be obtained at http://liblqr.wikidot.com.

The files in src/fft2d are taken from the fft2d package by 
Takuya OOURA (email: ooura@kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp) and have not been changed. 
The full package can be obtained at http://www.kurims.kyoto-u.ac.jp/~ooura/fft.html.
